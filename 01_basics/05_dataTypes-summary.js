// The data is divided on the basis of two categories one is that how we access the data and another is that how the data is stored in the memory

// There are two types of data types one is primitive and another is non primitive 

// ðŸ§± Primitive Data Types
// These are the most basic data types in JavaScript. They are immutable (cannot be changed) and are stored directly in memory.

// Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
// These are more complex and are stored as references in memory. They are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed.

//  Primitive

//  7 types : String, Number, Boolearn, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

const score = 100//number
const scoreValue = 100.3//number

const isLoggedIn = false//boolean
const outsideTemp = null//null
let userEmail;//undefined

const id = Symbol('123')//symbol
const anotherId = Symbol('123')//symbol

console.log("printing primitive");
console.log(id === anotherId);
console.log(id);
console.log(anotherId);

// const bigNumber = 3456543576654356754n  //bigInt



// Reference (Non primitive)
//3 types

// Array, Objects, Functions
console.log("printing non primitive");
